# Anti-afk

This Python script helps prevent being kicked from Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) games due to inactivity. It automates the jumping action at regular intervals to keep your character active in the game. The jump.exe file, included in this repository, records the space keypress for the jump action.

## Features:

- Automatically triggers jumps at set intervals to maintain in-game activity.
- Automatically identifies and interacts with all open CS2 windows.
- Customizable time interval for jump actions (default: 1 minute).
- Keeps track of the number of jumps performed during the session.
- Displays the jump count in the console for easy monitoring.


## Usage:

- Clone or download this repository.
- Ensure that the jump.exe file is in the same directory as the script.
- Adjust the time interval if needed.
- Run the script to start auto-jumping in all open CS2 windows.

### Feel free to contribute to or report issues with this script. Enjoy your uninterrupted CS2 experience!
